# Counter

First of all, thanks for being here.  Push a chair over there and make this place home for yourself.  I will start the explanation of this little application by saying *I know*.  "Wait .. What?"  I know why you are here.

You typed "counter" or "countdown" in Google and was dragged by a infinitude of online counters that are there to farm Ads.  You opened some of those sites and couldn't even see the numbers going down, because there were some Ad on top of it.

I also know one more thin.  You will not find what you look for here.  And that is fine.  Accept it as fast as you can so you can enjoy my sense of humor.  This little app exist to satisfy a very specific need from myself.  Because of that it certainly does not fit your need.  It is sad but not the end of world.  You have the code available for you to make it your little app.  Hum hum!  You are welcome.

This counter is a native application written in Racket.  Do yourself a favor and learn at least one Lisp.  Back to the application.  The counter can have one or two counters running.  And they serve my purpose of timeboxing discussions in some meetings.  Restriction nurtures focus and creativity.  When you see that you have 2 minutes to make your point, your brain stop joking around and focus on the task.  But why do you allow two counters?  I track the total time to discuss an item in the top one and the time that someone has to make a comment about the object in discussion.  There is no rock science here.  Not a typo, I wrote *rock* instead of *rocket* to test your attention.

Download this code, change the time of your counters on the call `start!` and execute it.  Ops.  It did not work because you need a copy of [Racket Programming Language](https://racket-lang.org/).  Go grab one, google "how to run a racket program" and run this one.  I believe that you will discover how to do that.  Tchau!
